    <h3>In my last summer vacation I went to Goa</h3>
    <p>
        Goa is India's smallest state, located on the country's western coast along the Arabian Sea,
        known for its beaches. It was a very fun and playful trip.<br>
        We explored a lot of things, visited both South and North Goa, and even went to Goa's capital.
